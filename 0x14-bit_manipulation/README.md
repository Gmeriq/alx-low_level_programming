C - Bit manipulation

How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
	Return: the converted number, or 0 if
		there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
		b is NULL

Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
	Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
	Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
	Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred

Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need
to flip to get from one number to another.
